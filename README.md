# Data Structures & Algorithms - JavaScript Implementation

A comprehensive journey through Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in JavaScript.

## 📚 Course Overview

### What is DSA?
Data Structures and Algorithms are the fundamental building blocks of efficient software. DSA helps us organize data and solve problems systematically.

### Course Requirements
- Basic JavaScript knowledge
- Node.js installed
- Code editor

### Course Setup
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd dsa-js
node filename.js
🎯 Core Concepts
Big O Notation
O(1) - Constant time

O(n) - Linear time

O(n²) - Quadratic time

O(log n) - Logarithmic time

🔧 Data Structures
Arrays
Custom Array implementation

Methods: push, pop, shift, unshift, deleteByIndex

Problems: Reverse String, Palindromes, Two Sum, Array Chunks

Linked Lists
Singly & Doubly Linked Lists

Methods: push, pop, shift, unshift, get, set, insert

Reverse Linked List

Stacks & Queues
LIFO vs FIFO structures

Methods: push/pop, enqueue/dequeue

Applications: Parenthesis validation, String reversal

Hash Tables
Key-value storage

Hash functions and collision handling

Applications: Word counter, Two Sum optimization

Trees & Graphs
Binary Search Trees (insert, search, traversal)

Graph operations (add vertex/edge, remove vertex/edge)

BFS and DFS traversal methods

🎪 Algorithms
Sorting
Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Problem Patterns
FizzBuzz
